1. Given a ready-made method, you need to cover its unit with tests.

int GetProductsAmount(const std::vector<int>& prices, int amountOfMoney);

2. You need to implement the IsLeapYear method according to the condition below and cover it with tests.

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4

except every year that is evenly divisible by 100

unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
